# Mazakote Project



- We are a passionate team focused on mechanics and electronics, and we are thrilled to participate in the **Sustainable Urban Race (SUR)** held in **Huelva, Andaluc√≠a, Spain**. This year marks our second time competing, and while we are excited, we face challenges in securing financial support and finding adequate spaces to work on our project. 

- As a small team that won the previous edition of the race, our goal is to return and claim victory once again!
