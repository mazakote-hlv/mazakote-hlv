# Mazakote Project

We are a passionate team focused on mechanics and electronics, and we are thrilled to participate in the **Sustainable Urban Race (SUR)** held in **Huelva, Andaluc√≠a, Spain**. This year marks our second time competing, and while we are excited, we face challenges in securing financial support and finding adequate spaces to work on our project. As a small team that won the previous edition of the race, our goal is to return and claim victory once again! You can learn more about the event by visiting the [Official SUR Website](https://www.uhu.es/surbanrace/).
You can also look at the source code of the vehicle, available in [this](https://github.com/mazakote-hlv/sur-24-source-code) public repository.
